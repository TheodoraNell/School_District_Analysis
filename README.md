# School District Analysis
Performing an analysis on school district data using Pandas

## Overview
The purpose of this analysis is to examine two sets of school and student data and create a summary of metrics evaluating math/reading performance and school spending. There is a repetition of the analysis using the same script but with the removal of potentially innacurate data. The results are then compared to explore the impact of the questionable data on the overall results. 

## Results
